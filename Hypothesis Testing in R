Hypothesis Testing
1.	An F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

H0: No difference in cutlet
H1: Has difference in cutlet

cutlet = read.csv(file.choose())
cutlet
attach(cutlet)
colnames(cutlet) <- c("Unit.A","Unit.B")

shapiro.test(Unit.A)
data:  Unit.A
W = 0.96495, p-value = 0.32

shapiro.test(Unit.B)
data:  Unit.B
W = 0.97273, p-value = 0.5225

Both follows Normal Distribution

var.test(Unit.A,Unit.B)

F test to compare two variances

data:  Unit.A and Unit.B
F = 0.70536, num df = 34, denom df = 34, p-value = 0.3136
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.3560436 1.3974120
sample estimates:
ratio of variances 
         0.7053649 

Both variances are equal

2 Sample T Test:

t.test(Unit.A,Unit.B,alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE)


Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  Unit.A and Unit.B
t = 0.72287, df = 66.029, p-value = 0.4723
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.09654633  0.20613490
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 7.019091  6.964297 


It accepts the Null hypothesis. No difference in the diameter of the Cutlet

2.	A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch. Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.
H0: No difference among the different lab
H1:Has difference among the different lab

Lab= read.csv(file.choose())
Lab
stacked_data <- stack(Lab)
attach(stacked_data)
stacked_data

library(normtest)
install.packages("goftest")
library(goftest)
ad.test(stacked_data$values)

Anderson-Darling test of goodness-of-fit
	Null hypothesis: uniform distribution
	Parameters assumed to be fixed

data:  stacked_data$values
An = Inf, p-value = 1.25e-06

It does not follow Normal distribution.

install.packages("RVAideMemoire")
library(RVAideMemoire)
attach(stacked_data)
stacked_data
mood.medtest(values~ind)

Mood's median test

data:  values by ind
X-squared = 129.27, df = 3, p-value < 2.2e-16

P Value<0.05, It rejects null Hypothesis, Has difference among the different lab




	


3.	Sales of products in four different regions is tabulated for males and females. Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions.
H0 : male-female buyer rations are similar across regions
H1 : male-female buyer rations are not similar across regions

Buyer=read.csv(file.choose())
Buyer
chisq.test(Buyer[,2:5])

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  Buyer[, 2:5]
X-squared = 1.5959, df = 3, p-value = 0.6603

P Value>0.05, It accepts null hypothesis.
male-female buyer rations are similar across regions

4.	TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain %  of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing.  The manager wants to check whether the defective %  varies by centre. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences
Ho : No of Defectives does not varies with centers
H1 : No of Defectives varies with centers
customer=read.csv(file.choose())
customer
attach(customer)
df = as.data.frame(cbind(c(Phillippines,Indonesia,Malta,India),rep(c("Phillippines","Indonesia","Malta","India"),c(300,300,300,300))))
colnames(df) <- c("Type","Location")
df
head(df)
chisq.test(df$Type,df$Location)

Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  df$Type and df$Location
X-squared = 3.859, df = 3, p-value = 0.2771

P Value>0.05, It accepts null hypothesis. No of Defectives does not varies with centers

5.	Fantaloons Sales managers commented that % of males versus females walking in to the store differ based on day of the week. Analyze the data and determine whether there is evidence at 5 % significance level to support this hypothesis.
Ho : males versus females walking in to the store doesnot differ based on day of the week.
H1 : males versus females walking in to the store differ based on day of the week.

Faltoons=read.csv(file.choose())
Faltoons
attach(Faltoons)
dffalt = as.data.frame(cbind(c(Weekdays,Weekend),rep(c("Weekdays","Weekend"),c(400,400))))
colnames(dffalt) <- c("Gender","Day")
dffalt
chisq.test(dffalt$Gender,dffalt$Day)

data:  dffalt$Gender and dffalt$Day
X-squared = 15.434, df = 1, p-value = 8.543e-05

P Value<0.05,It rejects null Hypothesis, males versus females walking in to the store differ based on day of the week.
